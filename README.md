# VSCode ROS2 Workspace Template

See [this template to set up VSCode for ros2 development with dev containers.](https://github.com/athackst/vscode_ros2_workspace/tree/humble).

## Features

### Style

ROS2-approved formatters are included in the IDE.  

* **c++** uncrustify; config from `ament_uncrustify`
* **python** autopep8; vscode settings consistent with the [style guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/The-ROS2-Project/Contributing/Code-Style-Language-Versions.html)

### Tasks

There are many pre-defined tasks, see [`.vscode/tasks.json`](.vscode/tasks.json) for a complete listing.  Feel free to adjust them to suit your needs.  

Take a look at [how I develop using tasks](https://www.allisonthackston.com/articles/vscode_tasks.html) for an idea on how I use tasks in my development.

### Debugging

This template sets up debugging for python files, gdb for cpp programs and ROS launch files.  See [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json) for configuration details.

### Continuous Integration

The template also comes with basic continuous integration set up. See [`.github/workflows/ros.yaml`](/.github/workflows/ros.yaml).

To remove a linter just delete it's name from this line:

```yaml
      matrix:
          linter: [cppcheck, cpplint, uncrustify, lint_cmake, xmllint, flake8, pep257]
```

## How to work on this repo
### Clone this repo

Clone this repo as normal.

### Open it in vscode

Open the repo in VSCode (File->Open Folder).
Search in the command palette "Remote Containers: Reopen in container" and select.

VSCode will build the dockerfile inside of `.devcontainer` for you.  If you open a terminal inside VSCode (Terminal->New Terminal), you should see that your username has been changed to `ros`, and the bottom left green corner should say "Dev Container"

### Update the template with your code

1. Specify the repositories you want to include in your workspace in `src/ros2.repos` or delete `src/ros2.repos` and develop directly within the workspace.
2. If you are using a `ros2.repos` file, import the contents `Terminal->Run Task..->import from workspace file`
3. Install dependencies `Terminal->Run Task..->install dependencies`
4. (optional) Adjust scripts to your liking.  These scripts are used both within tasks and CI.
   * `setup.sh` The setup commands for your code. Default to import workspace and install dependencies.
   * `build.sh` The build commands for your code. Default to `--merge-install` and `--symlink-install`
   * `test.sh` The test commands for your code.
5. Develop!


## FAQ

### WSL2

#### The gui doesn't show up

This is likely because the DISPLAY environment variable is not getting set properly.

1. Find out what your DISPLAY variable should be

      In your WSL2 Ubuntu instance

      ```
      echo $DISPLAY
      ```

2. Copy that value into the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file

      ```jsonc
      	"containerEnv": {
		      "DISPLAY": ":0",
         }
      ```

#### I want to use vGPU

If you want to access the vGPU through WSL2, you'll need to add additional components to the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in accordance to [these directions](https://github.com/microsoft/wslg/blob/main/samples/container/Containers.md)

```jsonc
	"runArgs": [
		"--network=host",
		"--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE",
		"--security-opt=seccomp:unconfined",
		"--security-opt=apparmor:unconfined",
		"--volume=/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix",
		"--volume=/mnt/wslg:/mnt/wslg",
		"--volume=/usr/lib/wsl:/usr/lib/wsl",
		"--device=/dev/dxg",
      		"--gpus=all"
	],
	"containerEnv": {
		"DISPLAY": "${localEnv:DISPLAY}", // Needed for GUI try ":0" for windows
		"WAYLAND_DISPLAY": "${localEnv:WAYLAND_DISPLAY}",
		"XDG_RUNTIME_DIR": "${localEnv:XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}",
		"PULSE_SERVER": "${localEnv:PULSE_SERVER}",
		"LD_LIBRARY_PATH": "/usr/lib/wsl/lib",
		"LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE": "1" // Needed for software rendering of opengl
	},
```

### Repos are not showing up in VS Code source control

This is likely because vscode doesn't necessarily know about other repositories unless you've added them directly. 

```
File->Add Folder To Workspace
```

Or you've added them as a git submodule.

To add all of the repos in your *.repos file, run the script

```bash
python3 .devcontainer/repos_to_submodules.py
```

or run the task titled `add submodules from .repos`
